# Python_Milestones

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific milestone. Navigate to a milestone directory to find the source code and additional instructions on running the scripts.

## Milestones Overview

[Milestone 1 “Back to school”](milestone_1) - Introduction to solving equations using Python.

[Milestone 2 “Secret messages”](milestone_1) - Implementing simple encryption and decryption algorithms.

[Milestone 3 “Pascal's Triangle”](milestone_3) - Implementing a function to generate Pascal's triangle up to a specified number of rows.

[Milestone 4 “Trade-offs”](milestone_4) - Developed a solution to find pairs of numbers that sum up to a target value. This includes both a brute-force approach and an optimized version to demonstrate the trade-off between time and space complexity.

[Milestone 5 “Ancient, Inc.”](milestone_5) - Automate the process of generating reports for employee birthdays and hiring anniversaries for Ancient, Inc. This task involves creating synthetic employee data using Faker and a reports generation, which are printed in console.

[Milestone 7 “Ancient, Inc.”](milestone_7) - Develop a Flask-based server application to serve as a backend for a command-line interface (CLI) utility. This utility will interact with the API developed in [Milestone 5 “Ancient, Inc.”](milestone_5).
